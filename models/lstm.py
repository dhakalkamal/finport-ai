"""
lstm.py — LSTM price forecasting model for FinPort-AI.

Planned implementation:
  - Load historical price data from the Price_History table via utils.db
  - Build and train an LSTM model (TensorFlow/Keras) per security
  - Generate short-term price forecasts and expose them via the /forecast/prices endpoint

This file is a placeholder. Logic will be implemented in a future phase.
