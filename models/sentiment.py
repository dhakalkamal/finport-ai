"""
sentiment.py — News sentiment analysis model for FinPort-AI.

Planned implementation:
  - Fetch recent news headlines for held securities via NewsAPI (newsapi-python)
  - Run FinBERT or a general BERT model (HuggingFace transformers) to classify sentiment
  - Write sentiment alerts to the Alert table with alert_type = 'SENTIMENT'

This file is a placeholder. Logic will be implemented in a future phase.
