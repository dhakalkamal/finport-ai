"""
rebalance.py — Smart portfolio rebalancing model for FinPort-AI.

Planned implementation:
  - Load current holdings and target allocations from Holding / Asset_Class tables via utils.db
  - Calculate drift between current and target weights
  - Generate buy/sell suggestions to bring portfolios back in line
  - Write results to the Rebalance_Log table

This file is a placeholder. Logic will be implemented in a future phase.
